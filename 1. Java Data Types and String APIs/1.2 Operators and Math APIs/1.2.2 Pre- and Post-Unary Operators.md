# 1.2.2 Pre- and Post-Unary Operators

## Pre-Unary Operators
These operators will either increment or decrement a variable before the equation is executed, without the need for additional operators or assignments:
```java
int xInt = 1;
++xInt; // 2
--xInt; // 1
```
- Note that pre-Unary operators also work on decimal numbers (e.g. floats and doubles), but will NOT increment the decimal part of the number
- Since pre-Unary operators take precedence, they will be used before the value of the variable is accessed:
```java
int xInt = 4;
int yInt = 7;
int zInt = 3;

int result = ++xInt + yInt + --zInt; // 14
```
- For multiple occurences of the pre-Unary operator in a single equation, each instance of the variable will be calculated in turn.

## Post-Unary Operators
Similar to Pre-Unary, there are increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.
The core difference is that the increment or decrement occurs after the value of the variable has been evaluated in the equation - hence it will be used AFTER the value has been. Example:
```java
int xInt = 1;
result = xInt++ + xInt + xInt++; // 5
```
Since the increment occurs AFTER the value has been used in the equation, this resolves to 5. After this calculation has completed, the value of `xInt` is now 3.
