# 1.1.7 - Alternative Number Systems

- Java supports:
    - Arabic (base-10)
    - Octal (base-8)
    - Hexadecimal (base-16)
    - Binary (base-2)
- To use difference number systems, different suffixes are used. For example:
```java
int w = 100; //base-10
int x = 0144; //base-8, starts with 0
int y = 0x0064; //base-16, starts with 0x
int z = 0b1100100; //base-2, starts with 0b
```
- The letters can be either lower or upper case, but conventionally they are kept lowercase.
- These numbers can be proven with the following code:
```java
if(w==x && x==y && y==z){
    // if true
} else {
    //if false
}
```
- These numbers can also use the underscore system discussed in 1.6, but cannot be placed before or after the prefix (e.g. 0b_)
