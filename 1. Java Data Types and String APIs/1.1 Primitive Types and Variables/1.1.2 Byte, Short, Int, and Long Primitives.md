# 1.1.2 - Byte, Short, Int, and Long Primitives

- Byte, Short, Int, and Long are integral have no decimal value and cannot express a fraction

- Bytes are a sequence of 8 bits that can store values in the range -128 < 127:
- Bytes are useful for arrays (e.g. byte arrays)
```java
byte maxByte = 127;
byte minByte = -128;
```

- Shorts are 16 bits, double the size of the byte:
```java
short maxShort = 32767;
short minShort = -32768;
```

- Ints are twice the size of a short, 32 bits, and have a max range up to 2.1 billion:
```java
int maxInt = 2147483647;
int minInt = -2147483648;
```

- Longs are the largest integral data type, with a range of 9.2 quintrillion:
- Longs are often used to measure time in milliseconds
- Longs are appended with an `L` or `l` - this tells the compiler the value is a long, and is required for literal values
```java
long maxLong = 9223372036854775807L;
long minLong = -9223372036854775808L;
```
