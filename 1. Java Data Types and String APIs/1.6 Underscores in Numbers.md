# 1.6 - Underscores in Numbers

- Commas can not be used in numbers since commas have reserved purposes in Java
- Underscores can be used instead of commas to format numbers:
```java
long worldPopulation = 7_640_000_000L;
```
- At compile time underscores are ignored, it is for human readibility only
- Underscores can be used in any integral number primitive as well as float/double (e.g. 3.456_6544_4554d;)
- However, you cannot use an underscore:
    - At the immediate start or end of a number (e.g. _534256, 654345_)
    - Immediately before or after the range suffix (e.g. _L)
    - Immediately before or after a decimal point
    - Immediately before or after a - sign.
