# 1.5 Narrowing, Widening, and Casting

## Widening
- Smaller primitives can fit into any larger primitive - this is called **widening**.
- Remember order of size - byte -> short -> int -> long
```java
byte byteValue = 100;
short shortValue = byteValue;
int intValue = shortValue;
long longValue = intValue;
```

- This is also true for float -> double, or for integral primitive -> float/double:
```java
float floatValue = 3.141592f;
double doubleValue = floatValue;

floatValue = intValue; // 100.0
doubleValue = longValue; // 100.0
```
- As is standard for a decimal primitive, attempting to assign a number larger than the max range will result in the number being stored in scientific notation
- In practice, this means that a float or double will not overflow - but it will loose accuracy

## Narrowing and Casting
- Widening to a larger primitive makes sense, but going to opposite way - larger to smaller, or **narrowing** - doesn't. Doing it with no modifications will result in overflow and crap data:
```java
long longValue = 65634535353435634L;
int intValue = longValue; // -1
short shortValue = intValue; // -1
//etc...
```
- Instead we need to use **casting**. Casting in Java allows for relative safety when narrowing data to smaller primitives. For example:
```java
long longValue = 100L;
intValue = (int) longValue; // 100
shortValue = (short) intValue; // 100
byteValue = (byte) shortValue; // 100
doubleValue = byteValue; // 100.0
floatValue = (float) doubleValue; // 100.0f
```
- Note that casting is mostly reliable, but for vastly different types some sanity checks are best practice to include.

## Widening and Narrowing between char and short
- An interesting use case is the type conversion between `char` and `short`. Remember that they are both 16-bit primitives, but have different ranges. Since there is some overlap:
    - A **positive** short will fit into a char since the positive range of a short is less than that of the char:
    ```java
    shortValue = 100;
    char charValue = (char) shortValue; // 100
    ```
    - A **positive** char will only fit into a short if the value is less than the upper positive bound of the short (i.e. <~32000):
    ```java
    charValue = 30000;
    shortValue = (short) charValue; // 30000
    ```
    - A **negative** short will overflow when cast to a char and a char **> short range** will overflow when cast as a short. These results are unpredictable and should be avoided.
