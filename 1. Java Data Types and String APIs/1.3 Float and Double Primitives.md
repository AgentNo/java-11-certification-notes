## 1.3 Float and Double Primitives

- Both floats and doubles can represent values with decimal numbers. For example:
```java
float piFloat = 3.14f;
float piDouble = 3.14;
```

- Floats will use 32 bits to store data, whereas doubles use 64 bits. This means that floats can store around 7 decimal places, and floats 15/16.
- Notice that floats require an `F` or `f` at the end of the number, similar to longs - if this is omitted, the compiler will treat the literal as a double
- Floats and doubles will both round the last digit if the literal is greater than the number of supported decimal places. For example:
```java
float piFloat = 3.141592653f
System.out.println(piFloat); // Output = 3.1415927
```

- Floats and doubles can be declared as decimal literals without a preceeding integer:
```java
float pFloat = .98768f
```

- Floats and doubles can also be assigned integer literals - unlike the integral primitives, floats and doubles will not overflow. If the value is too large, it will instead switch to scientific notation to accomodate the large number. This is true for both positive and negative values.
- Note that this can result in loss of accuracy since the original value is truncated:
```java
float longToFloat = 1111111111123343543535353553L; // Output = 1.11111113E18
double longToDouble = 1111111111123343543535353553L;
```
