## 1.4 Char Primitives

- The Char primitive is used almost entirely to represent unicode characters, but can hold a range of integral values like short or int
- Char is made up of 16 bits like a short, but does not have the same range! It is a positive integral, with a range of 0 to 65535:
```java
char minChar = 0;
char maxChar = 65535;
```

- If used to hold character or unicode literals, each character must be enclosed in single quotes. Double quotes makes it a string
```java
char aLetter = 'A';
char aUnicode = '\u0041';
char newLine = '\n';
```

- Under the hood, characters (literal or unicode representation) are stored as integer literals. For example:
```java
char aLetter = 'A';
char aNumber = 65;
```
- This can be demonstrated with the following test:
```java
if(aLetter == aUnicode && aUnicode == aNumber) {
    System.out.println("\\u0041, \'A\', and 65 are equal");
} else {
    System.out.println("They are NOT equal");
}
```
